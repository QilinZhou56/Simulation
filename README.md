# Simulation Codes Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of simulation codes for various scenarios and purposes. The simulations range from voting procedures and wait times in restaurants to treemap visualizations. These codes are intended to aid in learning and study, providing practical examples of simulation in different contexts.
