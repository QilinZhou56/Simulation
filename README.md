# Simulation Codes Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of simulation codes for various scenarios and purposes. The simulations range from voting procedures and wait times in restaurants to treemap visualizations. These codes are intended to aid in learning and study, providing practical examples of simulation in different contexts.

## Contents

- `voting_procedure.py`: This script simulates different voting procedures, illustrating how various voting systems can affect outcomes.
- `restaurant_wait_time.py`: A simulation of customer wait times in restaurants, useful for understanding queue management and service efficiency.
- `treemap_visualization.py`: Code to generate treemap visualizations, helpful for data analysis and presentation in a compact, visually appealing format.
